Import Library
#Import other necessary libraries like pandas, numpy...
from sklearn import tree
#Assumed you have, X (predictor) and Y (target) for training data set and x_test(predictor) of test_dataset
# Create tree object 
model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='gini') # for classification, here you can change the algorithm as gini or entropy (information gain) by default it is gini  
# model = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor() for regression
# Train the model using the training sets and check score
model.fit(X, y)
model.score(X, y)
#Predict Output
predicted= model.predict(x_test)


In a confusion matrix, false positives are called as: Type 1 error

The sensitivity of a model means: How many of the actual True data points are recognized as True data points by the model

If the sensitivity/recall of a model is high, then the Type 2 error is also high: False

Precision is inversely proportional to which type of error? Type 1 error

F1 score is Harmonic Mean of: Precision and Recall

Decision Trees is a Supervised Learning algorithm which can be used for: Both Classification and Continuous-Regression-type problems

Terminal Node is the node which cannot be further split in a Decision Tree: True

The Decision Tree in which the decision node can be split into more than 2 child nodes is: ChAID- Chi Squared Automatic Interaction Detectoret

When do we get the Gini index value equals to 0.5. Is it good or bad? Highly impure node. Class proportions are equal

For a perfectly pure node, we get the Ginni Index: 0
