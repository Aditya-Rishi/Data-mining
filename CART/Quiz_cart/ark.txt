Monday Review: Tricity this week
In the 56th edition of Monday Review, TOI's update from Chandigarh, Mohali, and Panchkula is that the Covid daily growth rate has dipped. Entries were made and purchase of Remdesivir was shown, but patients were not admitted. A private hospital was booked for cheating Covid patients. Markets open but rules have been tossed out. A lot of complaints are being received about the PPE kits. India’s first self-test kits for Covid-19 are out. Why wait in suspense when you can self-test Covid at home. DRDO’s Dipcovan kit will be available from next month for Rs 75 and takes 75 minutes. Pune-made Coviself costs Rs 250 but takes just 15 minutes. Check out the bulletin to know how it works. Many countries such as the UK use similar tests. Hopefully, this will improve the testing rate. The retreating Covid-19 tsunami has left India the Mucormycosis epidemic in its floating debris. From 50-60 a year, cases increased suddenly to more than 11,000. TOI's Shimona Kanwar got hold of Chandigarh microbiologist Jagdish Chander, who foresaw the destruction in 2018. The bulletin has a gist of what the doctor told TOI. Next Monday, we’ll talk of a Covid plan that’s ready since 1946. For your TOI copy, call us at this number: 1800 121 0005.
